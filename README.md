# Todo

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.22-1.

## Introduce

This is an time-travel todo app that was built with Angular 2 framework and integrated with Redux and localStorage. I do not use ng2-Redux since it is not necessary. ImmutableJS was considered too but it was too complicated to manage app state so it was removed.

## Setup

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
